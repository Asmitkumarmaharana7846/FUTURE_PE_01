**Next actions you can take:**

* Pair each title with a strong first 5-second hook spoken directly to students.
* If you want, I can map each title to a matching intro script and thumbnail text.

**Refinement question:**
Do you want these optimized more for **long-form YouTube** or **YouTube Shorts discovery**?
